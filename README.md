# DailyQuran
A client side web application that every muslim can use to listen
to qur’an through.
The Qur’an is divided into 30 parts , so as the month , everyday
you can listen to the corresponding part of qur2an , and every
part is divided by itself into 8 parts “hezb”,
every part is read by different sheikh by default and can be changed.

Unfortunately some links in Assets/js/qur2anDB.js are depricated now 
you can contribute adding links for you favourite shiekh.
